# Asynchronous response message cases and the messages returned when found to be true
#
# The XML Path Language expressions below are used to indicate when specific responses whould be returned.
# Seperated by semicolons; the first value item is the sdynchronous response to be returned and the
# subsequent XPATH expression items on any one line must all evaluate to true against the request
# for the asynchronous response to be returned.
#
# A single request may be configured through this .properties to then return multiple asynchronous responses
#
# The naming of keys within this file is significant as they will be sorted and prioritised in key
# name ascending order
